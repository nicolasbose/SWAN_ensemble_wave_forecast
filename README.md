# SWAN_ensemble_wave_forecast
This repository provide python scripts that help with the implemantatio o SWAN ensemble forecast system simulation. The meteo-ocean database used in this project are acquire from NOAA-NCEP sytem (https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov). 

- The bash file function is to help to download the forecast proveitide by NOAA-NCEP. Since, we are simulanting a ensemble of 10 day forecast lead-time, we generate a bash file that automatomace all the 30 SWAN runs

- The juptyter lab python scripts help to generate input for the SWAN runs, they create all the 31 senarios (30 members plus one control).
